		<h1>About this website</h1>
		<h2>Creation</h2>
		<p>
		I wanted to make my portfolio website as simple as possible, and to avoid using online website creation templates and hosting services. I dislike the trend in web design and software in general toward bloat and complexity. Although I could have likely used a service to create this website more easily, I see no reason that a massive, performance-hogging javascript webapp is necessary to create what is essentially just a list of text and images.
		</p>
		<p>
		As such, this website was written using notepad++ as a series of simple html, css, and (minimal) javascript files. It is hosted through GitHub using their Pages service. The result is a website that conveys all pertinent information with a minimum of resource usage necessary to serve and display it.
