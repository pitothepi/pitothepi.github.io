				My senior project involved the creation of an unfolding UAV. Among other tasks, I performed detailed simulation of our plane in Solidworks' Computational Fluid Dynamics suite. The simulation was quite thorough, including a rotating region for the propeller and multiple runs with a number of initial conditions to obtain information about the stability and aerodynamic performance of the aircraft.

				This is one image from the results of the simulation. I chose it because it demonstrates many of the insights gained:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is a large stagnation zone behind the fuselage that contributes to the design's low L/D.</li>
				<li>In addition to the expected wingtip vortices, there are additional vortices behind the wing joints.</li>
				<li>The flow acceleration from the prop is rather significant, which will affect lift generated by the wing.</li>
			</ul>

				This image shows the angle of attack sweep, and the effect of the propwash on the wing. It was used to decide what the maximum angle of attack was, which I compared to results from wing theory.

				This is an example of some of the calculations that were done with the numerical results from the simulation. From these results, I found the ideal trim conditions for the aircraft for both maximum range and endurance, as well as a host of other details.
